# SBOMAUDIT

SBOMAUDIT reports on the quality of the contents of an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) by performing a number of checks. SBOMs are supported in a number of formats including
[SPDX](https://www.spdx.org) and [CycloneDX](https://www.cyclonedx.org).

## Installation

To install use the following command:

`pip install sbomaudit`

Alternatively, just clone the repo and install dependencies using the following command:

`pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

The tool requires Python 3 (3.7+). It is recommended to use a virtual python environment especially
if you are using different versions of python. `virtualenv` is a tool for setting up virtual python environments which
allows you to have all the dependencies for the tool set up in a single environment, or have different environments set
up for testing using different versions of Python.

## Usage

```
usage: sbomaudit [-h] [-i INPUT_FILE] [--offline] [--cpecheck] [--purlcheck] [--disable-license-check] [--age AGE] [--maxage MAXAGE] [--allow ALLOW] [--deny DENY] [--verbose] [--debug] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-V]

SBOMAudit reports on the quality of the contents of a SBOM.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit

Input:
  -i INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE
                        Name of SBOM file

  --disable-license-check
                        disable check for SPDX License identifier
  --age AGE             minimum age of package (as integer representing days) to report (default: 0)
  --maxage MAXAGE       maximum age of package (as integer representing years) to report (default: 2)
  --allow ALLOW         Name of allow list file
  --deny DENY           Name of deny list file
  --verbose             verbose reporting

Output:
  --debug               add debug information
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                        output filename (default: output to stdout)
```
					
## Operation

The `--input-file` option is used to specify the SBOM to be processed. The format of the SBOM is determined according to
the following filename conventions.

| SBOM      | Format    | Filename extension |
| --------- | --------- |--------------------|
| SPDX      | TagValue  | .spdx              |
| SPDX      | JSON      | .spdx.json         |
| SPDX      | YAML      | .spdx.yaml         |
| SPDX      | YAML      | .spdx.yml          |
| CycloneDX | JSON      | .json              |

The `--offline` option is used when the tool is used in an environment where access to external systems is not available. This means
that some audit checks are not performed.

The `--cpecheck` and `--purlcheck` options are used to enable additional checks related to a SBOM component.

The `--disable-license-check` option is used to disable the check that the licenses have valid [SPDX License identifiers](https://spdx.org/licenses/).

The `--age` option can be used to report if a recent release of a package is being used.

The `--maxage` option can be used to report if the release date of a package, which is not the latest version, is greater than the value specified. The default value is 2 years.

The `--allow` and `--deny` options are used to specify additional checks related to licenses and packages which are to be allowed or denied within a SBOM component.
An **_allow_** file contains the set of licenses and packages which to be contained within the SBOM; this may be useful to ensure that the SBOM does not contain any
unapproved licenses or packages not identified in a software design. A **_deny_** file is used to specify the licenses and packages which must not be contained within the SBOM.

The `--verbose` option can be used to report the results of all the checks performed; the default is just report failed checks and summaries.

The `--output-file` option is used to control the destination of the output generated by the tool. The
default is to report to the console but can be stored in a file (specified using `--output-file` option).

### Allow and Deny list file formats

The files are text files consisting of two sections

- List of SPDX license identifiers
- Lst of Package names

Each section is optional.

In this sample allow file, this would only allow cemponents with the MIT, Apache-2.0 or BSD-3-Clause licenses.
It is also only expecting a single package 'click'.

```bash
# This is an example ALLOW list file for SBOMAUDIT
# Allowed licenses
[license]
MIT
Apache-2.0
BSD-3-Clause
# Allowed packages 
[package] 
click                                                           
```

## Checks Performed

The following section identifies the checks which are performed.

### SBOM Format

The following checks are performed:

- Check that the version of the SBOM is either version 2.2 or 2.3 (SPDX) or version 1.3, 1.4 or 1.5 (CycloneDX).

- Check that a creator is defined.

- Check that the time that the SBOM is created is defined.

### Files

The following checks are performed for each file item:

- Check that a file name is specified.

- Check that the file type is specified.

- Check that a license is specified and that the license identified is a valid [SPDX License identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/). Note that NOASSERTION is not considered a valid license.

- Check that the license is an [OSI Approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/) license.

- Optionally check that the license is allowed as specified in the ALLOW list

- Optionally check that the license is not included in the licenses specified in the DENY list

- Check that a copyright statement is specified. Note that NOASSERTION is not considered a valid copyright statement.

### Packages

The following checks are performed on each package item:

- Check that a package name is specified.

- Optionally check that the package name is allowed as specified in the ALLOW list

- Optionally check that the package name is not included in the packages specified in the DENY list

- Check that a supplier is specified.

- Check that a version is specified.

- Check that the package version is the latest released version of the package. The latest version checks are only performed if the `--offline` option is not specified and is only performed for Python modules available on the [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/).

- Check that a mature version of the package is being used as determined by the value specified in the `--age` option. The release date checks are only performed if the `--offline` option is not specified and is only performed for Python modules available on the [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/).

- Check the age of a package being used, which is not the latest released version, is greater than the value specified in the `--maxage` option.
The check is only performed if the `--offline` option is not specified and is only performed for Python modules available on the [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/).

- Check that a license is specified and that the license identified is a valid [SPDX License identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/). Note that NOASSERTION is not considered a valid license.

- Check that the license is an [OSI Approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/) license.

- Optionally check that the license is allowed as specified in the ALLOW list

- Optionally check that the license is not included in the licenses specified in the DENY list

- Check that a [PURL specification](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) is provided for the package.

- Check that a [CPE specification](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe) is provided for the package.

### Relationships

The following checks are performed:

- Check that relationships are defined.

- Check that every file is included in at least one relationship.

- Check that every package is included in at least one relationship.

### NTIA Conformance

The following checks are performed:

- Check that the contents of the SBOM meet the minimum requirements for an SBOM as defined by the [NTIA](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf).

## Example

Given the following SBOM (click.json)

```
{
  "$schema": "http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.4.schema.json",
  "bomFormat": "CycloneDX",
  "specVersion": "1.4",

            "url": "https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause"
          }
        }
      ],
      "externalReferences": [
        {
          "url": "https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/",
          "type": "other",

## Output File Format

The output file is in JSON format. The content depends on the contents of the SBOM and the specified command line options.

```bash
sbomaudit --input-file click.json --verbose --output-file click_analysis.json
```

As the `--verbose` option is specified, the resulting JSON file contains the results of all the checks which have been performed.
